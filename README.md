# ArduinoFun
Going through Arduino tutorials and documenting it!

## Chapter 1
Set up Arduino and got it to run a simple hello world program!

## Chapter 2
Wrote a simple blinking LED program.

## Chapter 4
Wrote a program that increases and decreases the PWM (pulse width modulation), essentially fading the LED off and on.

## Chapter 5
Wrote a program that sequentially turns on LEDS.

## Chapter 7
Wrote a program that turns on a really loud and annoying buzzer in a siren fashion.

## Chapter 9
Wrote a program that uses a potentiometer to either turn a red/green led on depending on the value of it.

## Notes
Followed tutorial from [SainSmart](https://www.sainsmart.com/) (not a very good tutorial as it lost a lot of detail through poor translation. Just means more experimenting :smiley:).<br>
Skipped chapters 3/6/8.

## Ideas to implement
A breakout game using the 8x8 matrix and buttons/potentiometer or snake.<br>
A continous prime generator that flashes a light when it finds one and adds it to a list.
